# Teacher-Pay-Calculator

# Description:

A simplistic program written in Python language for the purposes of determining a teacher's annual salary over X amount of years, while accounting for an annual percentage increase. This program will allow those in the education field to determine their annual salary for years to come, while displaying the information in an easy-to-read chart format.


# Instructions:

To use the Teacher Pay Calculator, you will require three pieces of key information:
1. The teacher's starting salary.
2. The teacher's annual increase percentage.
3. The number of years to be calculated.

Upon running the program, it will produce an inquiry for the user:

"What is the teacher's Starting Salary?"

Once this message has appeared, the program is ready for input and the user may proceed by entering the starting salary of the teacher in question. The program will then use the entered value as it's first variable. For flexibility and practicality, this variable has been set to a 'floating' variable to allow decimal usage.

After the teacher's starting salary has been entered, the program will then ask the user for further information:

"What is the Annual Increase percentage?"

Here the user will be asked to enter the teacher's annual increase percentage (the percentage by which the teacher's salary in increased per year). This variable has also been set to a 'floating' variable to allow decimal numbers within the percentage, such as an increase of 5.6% versus a flat increase of 5%, as is often the case.

Once the program has obtained the first two variables, it only requires one more piece of information:

"How many years will the teacher be earning a salary?"

When this message appears the user will be prompted to enter how many consecutive years they wish to calculate. This number will determine how many iterations of the equation will be ran, and how many rows of information will be displayed in the final result. Once this final variable has been entered the program will then calculate what the teachers theoretical salary would be for the amount of years given, with the teacher's salary increasing with each iteration. The program will then display this information is a chart format, with the year in question listed on the left in numerical order, and the corresponding end-of-year salary being presented in dollars on the right. If the user wishes to use the program again, or generate a different chart with different variables, simply restart the program, and the first prompt ("What is the teacher's Starting Salary?") will appear again.
